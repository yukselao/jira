# PostgreSQL database for Jira

During my local Jira installation tests, I needed a database to complete the Jira setup. This script automatically provisions a PostgreSQL database instance running on Docker. Using the configuration created by the script, you can quickly and easily complete the Jira installation.


```bash
chmod +x setup/setup_jira_pg.sh
./setup/setup_jira_pg.sh
```
